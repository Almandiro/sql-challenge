# sql-challenge

In this SQL exercise, everything was built through PostGREs and PG Admin.

Under thisrepository, if you go to [Employee Data](https://github.com/Almandiro/sql-challenge/tree/main/EmployeeSQL/data), you'll find an SQL file and an ERD file.  

	Both were generated through PG_Admin

	The SQL file contains the Tables, the Data, AND all the VIEWS
